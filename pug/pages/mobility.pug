        The Polytechnic Institute of Bragança has an internationalization program of recognized success, involving the annual mobility of more than 500 students and 100 teachers, the result of collaboration with several European higher education institutions (Erasmus program) and Portuguese-speaking countries. Studying at IPB represents an opportunity for an international mobility experience; an added value for the training and employability of our students and graduates.
        The International Relations Office (GRI) page is the main vehicle for communicating with students and faculty at IPB and its partner institutions.
